# Package conventions in `{{ROOT_PACKAGE}}`

You should be able to learn everything a package here offers by reading **one**
file — its `__init__.py` — and to trust that reading. That is true because it is
checked: `tach check` fails on any import that reaches past a package's public
surface. This is a constraint, not a suggestion.

## The rule

**Private means a name starting with `_`.** From outside a package, you may
import a name only if every segment of its path starts with something other than
an underscore.

```python
from {{TIER_IMPORT}}{{EXAMPLE}} import total_due              # fine: the package's public surface
from {{TIER_IMPORT}}{{EXAMPLE}}.quote import estimate         # fine: a further public entry point
from {{TIER_IMPORT}}{{EXAMPLE}}._internal._totals import total_due   # fails `tach check`
```

Inside a package, its own modules import each other however they like. The rule
governs what crosses the package boundary, not how the implementation behind it
is arranged.

## The shape

```
{{PACKAGE_TIER}}/
  {{EXAMPLE}}/
    __init__.py     the public surface: named re-exports + __all__
    quote.py        a further entry point — public, because no leading underscore
    _internal/      everything else, unreachable from outside
      _totals.py
```

`{{EXAMPLE}}` above is an illustration, not necessarily a package in this repo:
the shape applies to every package under `{{PACKAGE_TIER}}/`, whichever they are.

Adding a package, or a private folder inside one, needs no edit to `tach.toml`.
The rule is written once, generically, and applies to whatever is there.

## Writing an interface

Re-export explicit names and list them in `__all__`:

```python
from ._internal._invoice import Invoice
from ._internal._totals import total_due

__all__ = ["Invoice", "total_due"]
```

**Never `from ._internal import *`.** A star re-export makes the public surface
unenumerable, which defeats the one thing this whole arrangement buys: that a
reader — human or agent — learns the package from a single file. `tach` checks
the import boundary, not the re-export style, so this rule is yours to keep.

Keep the surface small. A package with thirty exported names is not a deep
module; it is a folder. When one gets that large, the question is what it is
hiding, and usually the answer is: not enough.

## Running the check

```sh
{{CHECK_COMMAND}}
{{CYCLE_COMMAND}}
```

A clean exit means every import in the repo goes through a public surface. A
violation names the offending import, so there is nothing to hunt for.

The tests at the repo root are code outside every package, so the same rule
forces them through the public surfaces too. A passing suite is evidence the
interfaces are usable.
